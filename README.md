## Course Description

This course covers current concepts in database theory and use, with a focus on design, implementation, and utilization of database management systems. The main topics of the course include database requirements, ER modeling, relational modeling, database constraints, update anomalies, normalization, SQL, the database front-end, data quality, and database administration.

**Prerequisites:** BTM 111 with a 2.0 or higher, or instructor permission.
 
## Course Goals

Upon Completion of this course, students will be able to:
			
1. Understand the basics of database design.
2. Learn the terminology used to discuss database systems.
3. Competently visualize database requirments using ER modeling. 
3. Understand relationships in a relational database management systems.
5. Know the different forms of normalization and how to apply them.
6. Be capable of basic database administration. 
7. Become familiar with SQL.


## Textbook (required):

Database Systems – Introduction to Databases and Data Warehouses
<cite>Jukic, Vrbsky, Nestorov</cite>

Available at the College Bookstore.<br>
**ISBN-10:** 1943153191<br>
**ISBN-13:** 978-1943153190<br>
And also on [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Database-Systems-Introduction-Databases-Warehouses/dp/1943153191/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1522645006&sr=8-1&keywords=9781943153190)

## Assignments/Projects

Regular assignments will be posted in Canvas. All assignments are designed to give the student practice with new skills, concepts, and tools covered in class.

Your homework must be turned in on time. Late submissions may be granted partial credit when accompanied by an ingenuitive excuse. Generally speaking, students will learn more if coursework is up-to-date with the lecture. Unfortunately, assignments turned in after course end will receive 0 points. 

## Quizzes/Exams

There will occasionally be quizzes designed to test knowledge retention and evaluate class progression.

There will also be a Midterm and Final exam, both of which will constitue of large portion of your final grade. (See the schedule for dates).

## Evaluation (subject to change)

Evaluation will be based on Assignments, Quizzes, and the Final Exam.


## Materials

USB Drive or Cloud Storage and/or Personal Laptop.


## Attendance 

While regular attendance is not technically mandatory, in practice, it usually is. This is by design to mimic “real life” scenarios. Often times, showing up is the most important thing. And being present for lectures, quizzes, and code reviews will greatly improve your grade.  

This is a programming class and you need to be prepared to work hard and to spend an adequate amount of time outside of the classroom studying and practicing.   

## Helping / Working with Others

I encourage you to work with other class members, which is how real life software is produced. However, you must hand in your own assignments. If found cheating, you will receive no credit and be subject to college disciplinary action. For more information, refer to your Academic Dishonesty Policy in the college catalog or student handbook.

## Accessibility

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or have emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in BE1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) to be handed to instructor.

# Americans with Disability Act (ADA) (BE1112)

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or have emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in BE1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) to be handed to instructor.

## Accommodation Process:

- If a student contacts the instructor about an accommodation request the instructor will refer the student to the Disability Support Service office in BE1112 for an appointment to discuss accommodation needs.

- If the DSS office determines that the student does indeed have a disability the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) that will state the accommodation to be implemented.

- The student’s responsibility is to hand the LOA to the instructor. The instructor will sign the letter (if there is agreement with the accommodation) and give it back to the student. Student will return the LOA to DSS.
